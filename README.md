# Dynamic Greeting

**Dynamic Greeting** is a web service that provides personalized greetings based on the local time of your selected country. Whether it's "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Night," our platform dynamically adjusts the salutation to match the time of day in your chosen location.

## Features

- Personalized greetings based on the local time.
- Changes the image according to the Greetings
- Seamlessly adjusts the greeting to your chosen country.
- Enhance online interactions with a touch of personalization.

## Usage

1. Visit the [Dynamic Greeting website](https://dynamicgreetings.netlify.app/) in your web browser.
2. Append the `ip` query parameter to the URL with a positive integer to select your country.

Example: `https://example.com/?ip=68` for England and by default its for India or if you provide even ip in Params it will show for India's greeting && if you provide the ip in arams which is divisible by 10 then it will show for America's greeting according to local time in America.
